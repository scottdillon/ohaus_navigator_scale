# Excel VBA Serial Port Access

This is code I use in an Excel file to access the serial port and get a measurement from an [Ohaus Navigator scale](http://www.ohaus.com/en-US/NavigatorXT). The system I was using it on was a 64bit Windows 10 computer. The VBA function was run through a button I added to the ribbon for easy use. 

The majority of the code was taken from [this website](http://www.thescarms.com/vbasic/commio.aspx) and was written by David Hitchener, not myself. I merely wrote the last function for my particular device.

The code stopped working on 8/8/2017. Presumably after a windows update...
